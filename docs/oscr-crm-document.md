# OSCR Creating / Editting a CRM document

## Navigating through the panel interface
Once you have created a new document or chosen one for editting you can navigate through the "panels" and the fields they contain in two ways.

	* right - move from panel containing the fields to the "input panel" which opens up to the right whenever a new fields is chosen
	* left - move to the panel immidiately to the left of the panel in focus
	
## Editting field values
One of the underlying philosopies of the OSCR project is that rather than inputting values directly, values are 'selected' from pre-defined vocabularies/authority files. For Title-, Description- or Comment-like fields direct input is required. But for many other fields you will be presented with a regular text-input field with 'type-ahead' functionlity. This means that as you type, a comparison will be made to that field's linked vocabulary and several 'matches' will be returned from which a value can be selected. If no match is found it is also possible to create a new vocabulary entry by clicking on the "New" button directly below the text-input field. After filling in the required fields, click the 'Create' button. This store and add the new entry to a 'local' vocabulary list for that particular field. Other users working on other documents will now have this field value available for selection.

## Adding documentation
Each field's input panel contains a documentation section. To change or add to the documentation press the edit icon at the bottom left of the documentation widget. A modal window will appear to add/edit the documentation. 

The modal window should also say which language the documentation should be in (depending on the configured/chosen) interface language.

	Explain "Condition" into language "en"

## Saving the document
Click "Save Document" above the panels
