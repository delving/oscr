            <ol>
                <li>click on "Yes" with your mouse</li>
                <li>Or with the keyboard:
                    <ul>
                        <li>regular text input: press [ENTER]</li>
                        <li>textarea (for longer descriptions) press [TAB] and then [ENTER]</li>
